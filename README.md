Sample extensions
=======

These samples demonstrate techniques for building an extension with an HTML5 UI and behavior implemented in JavaScript.

You must use CEP 5.0 for extensions that target the CC2014 version of the host application. You must have the host application installed to run the extension. Supported host apps include the CC2014 versions of: Dreamweaver, Flash Pro, InDesign, Illustrator, InCopy, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Prelude, and After Effects

(These samples are being developed. Some of them use CEP 4 and the CC version of the host app. Requirements are listed.)
