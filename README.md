Sample extensions
=======

These samples demonstrate techniques for building an extension with an HTML5 UI and behavior implemented in JavaScript. 

The samples are kept up to date with the latest CC2018 host applications. Make sue to check the `manifest.xml` file for each sample's compatible host applications. To run the extensions you must have the compatible host application installed. Requirements for each sample are listed below.
 
Each version of CEP comes with its own samples in the [CEP-Resources repository](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources). Under each version name, `CEP_N.x`, you will find the version specific samples, which cover broad use cases and topics of CEP. 

Unlike the samples in the [CEP-Resources repository](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources), samples in this repository cover specific use cases covering a wide variety of topics. Check out the next section to choose a sample that suits your need.

## Before running the samples
1. The provided samples are unsigned. This will cause the signature check (built into CEP when first running an extension) to fail. To bypass the signature check, please refer to [the documentation](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/CEP_8.x/Documentation/CEP%208.0%20HTML%20Extension%20Cookbook.md#debugging-unsigned-extensions).
1. Although these extensions are initially setup for a particular version of CEP, you can adjust the product version targeted by modifying the range inside the `HostList` element of the `CSXS/manifest.xml` file.
1. Some folders have a nested folder strucutre. For those samples, you will need to extract sub-directories into [the extension folder](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/CEP_8.x/Documentation/CEP%208.0%20HTML%20Extension%20Cookbook.md#extension-folders).
