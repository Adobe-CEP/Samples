Sample extensions
=======

These samples demonstrate techniques for building an extension with an HTML5 UI and behavior implemented in JavaScript. 

These samples are still in development. Some of them use CEP 4 and the CC2013 version of the host app, and others are for CEP 5 and the new CC2014 version of the host application. You must have the host application installed to run an extension. Requirements for each sample are listed.

* Supported host apps for CEP 5 include the CC2014 versions of: Dreamweaver, Flash Pro, InDesign, Illustrator, InCopy, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Prelude, and After Effects. 
* Support for the Flash/ActionScript extension model is deprecated in all apps, and has been removed from Photoshop CC2014.
